This calendar is free to download and add/subscribe using whatever calendar you use professionally or personally.

The file is for 2026. I will release a new version for 2027 in or around November/December of 2026, and same with all future years. Each consecutive calendar will use some new messages, and also many of the same messages, but scheduled for different days.

These positive affirmations are not my own words, but graciously and gratefully found on the following websites:
